# Dungeon Crawl P2P

Goal is to recreate dungeon crawl in Bevy (using Bevy rendering etc) that works on web and Mac OS and that can be with 2 players. Unclear if it should still be turn-based.

Focusing on generating the map for now. Assume it will become a resource.
But for now, lets generate walls vs floors (just diff color boxes for now).
And lets create the diff room architects. We can add exit and amulet and player.
